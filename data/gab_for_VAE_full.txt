You made several good points but your use of the word "retarded" makes it offensive to some people. It's unnecessary, just remove it.
This made sense until you started using anti-female slurs which have nothing to do with your point.
By name calling don't you think you are just adding to the problems we have? Can't we have a disagreement without bashing?
This post has several typos, it would be best to just delete it all together.  The word cunt is extremely vulgar and so unnecessary to use.
Your point would be better accepted if you made it without using slurs.
I don't understand why you are making a joke out of hurting people's feelings.
I understand what you are saying but it's hard to agree with you when you use that kind of language.
Please don't make this a matter of race rather than of ideology.
Religion is a personal choice that has nothing with a persons mental state. And it is wrong to mock people with disabilities.
I'd be inclined to agree with you if you didn't use slurs.
Your fear of Jewish people controlling everything probably has another source.
Your anti-semitism is quite off putting. You would probably be happier if you could open your mind.

I don't agree with him either, but the hateful slurs are not appropriate.
Those are incredibly offensive terms, you can do better.
