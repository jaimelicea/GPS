## Introduction
This repo is the code implementation for "[Generate, Prune, Select: A Pipeline for Counterspeech Generation against Online Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01625.pdf)" (ACL-IJCNLP Findings 2021). 

This project aims at __counterspeech generation__, which is, for a given hate speech instance, to generate a counter response intending to de-escalate the hateful setting.
An illustrative example pair is shown in Table 1, where the counterspeech was manually crafted in response to the hate speech instance.

Our model consists of three modules: 
<p align="center"><img width="90%" src="img/model.png"/></p>

1. A __Candidate Generation__ module that uses a generative model to create a large number of diverse response candidates for selection. 
2. A __Candidate Pruning__ module that leverages a pretrained contextualized language model (BERT) to filter the candidate pool and eliminate ungrammatical candidates. 
3. A __Response Selection__ module that utilizes a retrieval-based response selection model to select the most relevant counterspeech from the pruned candidate pool.


## Requirements
The code is based on Python 3.7. Please install the dependencies as below:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Data
__Reddit__, __Gab__: Please download the data from [A Benchmark Dataset for Learning to Intervene in Online Hate Speech](https://github.com/jing-qian/A-Benchmark-Dataset-for-Learning-to-Intervene-in-Online-Hate-Speech/tree/master/data) (EMNLP2019) and put the two ```.csv``` files in the folder ```./data/A-Benchmark-Dataset-for-Learning-to-Intervene-in-Online-Hate-Speech-master/``` 

__CONAN__: Please download the data from [CONAN - COunter NArratives through Nichesourcing: a Multilingual Dataset of Responses to Fight Online Hate Speech](https://github.com/marcoguerini/CONAN) (ACL2019) and put the ```CONAN.json``` file in the folder ```./data/CONAN/```


## Code:
### Module 1: Candidate Generation 
First, extract all counterspeech in the training dataset to a `.txt` file under `./data/`. Each counterspeech takes one line. 
An example is `./data/sample_for_VAE.txt`.

Then, the module has two steps: __generative model training__ and __candidate generation__. Please run: 
```
python ./VAE_Text_Generation.py --dataset reddit --training
```

### Module 2: Candidate Pruning
Please download our pretrained grammaticality classifier [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hw5na_Iy4-kGEoX60bD8vXYeJDQrzyj6/view?usp=sharing), unzip it, rename the folder ```grammar_cola``` and put it under ```./tmp/```.

### Module 3: Response Selection
```
python ./Main.py --dataset reddit
```
